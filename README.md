# Justin Katzwhite’s Resumé
I created this app to act as a digital resumé. Not only can I explain my educational and workplace background but I can demonstrate my understanding of specific programming languages by presenting a functional mobile application. These languages include: Android/Java, Python/REST API, GAE/NoSQL, HTML5/CSS/JavaScript. Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justin.resume

*Disclaimer: This app is not functional because of missing files left out intentionally. This repo is more designed as a snippet of the work I’ve done and allows others to view the work I’ve disclosed in my resume.*

*If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback, please e-mail me at jkatzwhitew@gmail.com*
