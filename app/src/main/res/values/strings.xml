            I’ve been programming in Java and developing Android applications for over three
            years.

            \n\nI’ve developed android apps that use activities, fragments, layouts,
            adapters, classes, client libraries designed to communicate with backend APIs,
            LRUcache, SQLite and navigation drawers. These apps have used the camera and nfc
            adapter in smartphones. I\'ve also used Firebase services such as crashlytics,
            authentication and uploading images.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve designed backend APIs in Python that communicate with frontend client applications
            using JSON. I\'m familiar with OAuth2.0.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve designed cloud applications in Python supported by Google App Engine (GAE). These
            applications use the webapp2 framework and the Jinja template.

            \n\nI’ve also created NoSQL databases that supply data to the web application and the
            backend API. I’ve used cloud applications to transmit various data including text, image
            urls and prices.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve created web applications using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS and have had these
            applications interact with the cloud applications I’ve created.

            \n\nBy interacting, data could be submitted to the cloud database and retrieved as well.</item>

            I started learning and programming in Java in the end of 2014. In early 2015 I started developing Android apps
            in Java. I’ve developed a strong understanding of the Android framework including activities, fragments,
            layouts and views. As well as more advanced features such as adapters, client libraries designed to communicate
            with backend APIs, SQLite databases and navigation drawers. Because of my work on Tastebudz, I’ve developed a
            very strong understanding of the nfc adapter found in Android powered smartphones.

            \n\nIn keeping up with the latest technology, I’ve worked with software included in Android Jetpack such as ViewModel,
            RecylcerView, LiveData and Room.

            \n\nSome of the apps I\'ve developed use Google Play Services such as Google Maps.

            \n\nI test many of the Android apps I develop using jUnit and Espresso.

            I started developing Android apps in Kotlin in the beginning of 2019. Learning the change in syntax and
            structure required some patience but now I’ve come to appreciate the simplicity that Kotlin was intended to
            provide. I’m still learning the intricacies of Kotlin but I’m getting better every day. In fact, this entire
            app is written in Kotlin.

    <string-array name="Cloud">
        <item>
            I started programming in Python in the middle of 2015. Eager to learn about cloud computing and how a mobile
            app interacted with a cloud backend, I started working on example projects on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
            Recently, I’ve migrated from Python 2 to Python 3.

            \n\nI leverage many of Python’s features. I use pip for downloading packages. I have a very strong understanding
            of data models such as dictionaries. I leverage many of Python’s built-in functions and can implement newer
            technology such as lambda functions.

            \n\nI practice good testing habits and test many of my Python scripts using PyTest.
        </item>
        <item>
            I’ve been developing Python apps hosted on GCP since 2015. Starting with Cloud SDK, I’ve have used many programs
            that come with the package such as dev_server, endpointscfg, appcfg. Before uploading my app to App Engine, I
            would test it using dev_server. This is how quickly learned many APIs.

            \n\nI’ve worked with Datastore, Google’s NoSql database; Memcache, for storing tokens; creating my own endpoints,
            the Requests API and Stackdriver.

            \n\nRecently I’ve learned about concurrency by using Python’s asyncio. I’ve also learned about kubernetes, compute
            engine, cloud functions, big query and big table.

        <item>
            I have some experience with AWS. While I’m not as familiar with it as GCP, I’m learning more about the features

        <item>
            I started working with Firebase in the middle of 2017. Looking to add messaging and profiles to Tastebudz, I
            started learning about the features Firebase had to offer. I linked my GCP project to Firebase and activated
            the messaging capability. I created a new endpoint in my backend for messaging and added the feature to
            Tastebudz.

            \n\nFor the profiles, I created a new activity in the Tastebudz app and added an endpoint in my backend for
            registering profiles.

            \n\nI would later add a menu building activity in Tastebudz. To store the menu item images, I used Firebase
            storage, which linked with my project\'s cloud storage, and populated it with the images uploaded.

            \n\nTo catch any errors that might occur while people were running Tastebudz, I included Firebase’s Crashlytics.
            Crashlytics catches errors and crashes and then sends an email to the project owners informing them about
            what happened. Crashlytics is a very useful tool for ensuring flawless performance.

            improvements to the source code I work on. I use Gradle to synchronize the additional libraries and dependencies
            that each app uses. I test the apps I develop on smartphones as well as Android Studio’s emulator. I’m able to
            leverage Android Studio’s refactoring capability to quickly make changes across the source code. I use Logcat to
            track the events that occur while the app is running and Profiler to view how efficiently the app is running.

    <string name="background_information">
        \nI\'ve been developing mobile apps since 2015.
        I spent a year learning and programming in multiple programming languages such as Java and Python.
        Now I\'m able to utilize technology essential to many different applications. I have two applications found
        on the Google Play Store.

        Tastebudz is an app I developed that is intended for the restaurant industry. By using the nfc adapter on
        customer\'s phone, customers can quickly scan an nfc tag and be paired with the restaurant\'s menu. This allows
        for digital ordering and many more features.

        In 2006 I enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of
        Engineering and in 2010 I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in
        mathematics. From my pursuit of a B.S., I\'ve learned to work effectively in a team setting.

        \n\nDuring my stay, I contributed to research studying Power Quality (PQ) events in power
        lines and power outlets.

        \n\nAfterwards, I worked for over 4 years at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
        My daily activities included reviewing and prosecuting applications and arguing against and
        negotiating with patent attorneys. I worked at the GS-11 level.
