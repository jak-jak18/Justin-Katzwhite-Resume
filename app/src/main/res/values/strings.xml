    <!--Background Text-->
    <string name="background_information">
        I\'ve been developing mobile apps since 2015.
        I spent a year learning and programming in multiple programming languages such as Java and Python.
        Now I\'m able to utilize technology essential to many different applications. I have two applications found
        on the Google Play Store.

        Tastebudz is an app I developed that is intended for the restaurant industry. By using the nfc adapter on
        customer\'s phone, customers can quickly scan an nfc tag and be paired with the restaurant\'s menu. This allows
        for digital ordering and many more features.

        In 2006 I enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of
        Engineering and in 2010 I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in
        mathematics. From my pursuit of a B.S., I\'ve learned to work effectively in a team setting.

        \n\nDuring my stay, I contributed to research studying Power Quality (PQ) events in power
        lines and power outlets.

        \n\nAfterwards, I worked for over 4 years at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
        My daily activities included reviewing and prosecuting applications and arguing against and
        negotiating with patent attorneys. I worked at the GS-11 level.

    <string-array name="Android">
        <item>
            I started learning and programming in Java at the end of 2014. In early 2015 I started developing Android apps
            in Java. I’ve developed a strong understanding of the Android framework including activities, fragments,
            layouts and views. As well as more advanced features such as adapters, client libraries designed to communicate
            with backend APIs, SQLite databases and navigation drawers. Because of my work on Tastebudz, I’ve developed a
            very strong understanding of the NFC adapter found in Android powered smartphones.

            \n\nIn keeping up with the latest technology, I’ve worked with software included in Android Jetpack such as ViewModel,
            RecylcerView, LiveData and Room.

            \n\nSome of the apps I\'ve developed use Google Play Services such as Google Maps.

            \n\nI test many of the Android apps I develop using jUnit and Espresso.

            I started developing Android apps in Kotlin in the beginning of 2019. Learning the change in syntax and
            structure required some patience but now I’ve come to appreciate the simplicity that Kotlin was intended to
            provide. I’m still learning the intricacies of Kotlin but I’m getting better every day. In fact, this entire
            app is written in Kotlin.

    <string-array name="Cloud">
        <item>
            I started programming in Python in the middle of 2015. Eager to learn about cloud computing and how a mobile
            app interacted with a cloud backend, I started working on example projects on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
            Recently, I’ve migrated from Python 2 to Python 3.

            \n\nI leverage many of Python’s features. I use pip for downloading packages. I have a very strong understanding
            of data models such as dictionaries. I leverage many of Python’s built-in functions and can implement newer
            technology such as lambda functions.

            \n\nI practice good testing habits and test many of my Python scripts using PyTest.
        </item>
        <item>
            I’ve been developing Python apps hosted on GCP since 2015. Starting with Cloud SDK, I’ve have used many programs
            that come with the package such as dev_server, endpointscfg, appcfg. Before uploading my app to App Engine, I
            would test it using dev_server. This is how quickly learned many APIs.

            \n\nI’ve worked with Datastore, Google’s NoSql database; Memcache, for storing tokens; creating my own endpoints,
            the Requests API and Stackdriver.

            \n\nRecently I’ve learned about concurrency by using Python’s asyncio. I’ve also learned about kubernetes, compute
            engine, cloud functions, big query and big table.
        </item>
        <item>
            I have some experience with AWS. While I’m not as familiar with it as GCP, I’m learning more about the features
            it has to offer.
        </item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="Firebase">
        <item>
            I started working with Firebase in the middle of 2017. Looking to add messaging and profiles to Tastebudz, I
            started learning about the features Firebase had to offer. I linked my GCP project to Firebase and activated
            the messaging capability. I created a new endpoint in my backend for messaging and added the feature to
            Tastebudz.

            \n\nFor the profiles, I created a new activity in the Tastebudz app and added an endpoint in my backend for
            registering profiles.

            \n\nI would later add a menu building activity in Tastebudz. To store the menu item images, I used Firebase
            storage, which linked with my project\'s cloud storage, and populated it with the images uploaded.

            \n\nTo catch any errors that might occur while people were running Tastebudz, I included Firebase’s Crashlytics.
            Crashlytics catches errors and crashes and then sends an email to the project owners informing them about
            what happened. Crashlytics is a very useful tool for ensuring flawless performance.

    <string-array name="IDE">
        <item>
            I\'ve been working with Android Studio since it came out in beta. Today, I have an excellent understanding of
            the IDE and leverage several features during development. I use Android Studio’s VCS capability to push daily
            improvements to the source code I work on. I use Gradle to synchronize the additional libraries and dependencies
            that each app uses. I test the apps I develop on smartphones as well as Android Studio’s emulator. I’m able to
            leverage Android Studio’s refactoring capability to quickly make changes across the source code. I use Logcat to
            track the events that occur while the app is running and Profiler to view how efficiently the app is running.
        </item>
        <item>
            I\'ve been using PyCharm since the middle of 2015. I use PyCharm to create python apps that are uploaded to GCP.
            After creating a virtual environment, I use pip to download GCP packages, write the code using these packages
            and test the scripts using dev_server provided by Cloud SDK.
        </item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="OS">
        <item>
            Before 2019, Windows was the only OS I had worked with. I had become very familiar with both command line and
            PowerShell. I also have technical experience with Microsoft Excel.
        </item>
        <item>
            Since the beginning of 2019 I\'ve been developing in a Linux environment. With Linux Mint as my distro,
            I\'ve picked up the terminal commands and have come to embrace the open source community.
        </item>
    </string-array>

    <string-array name="Github">
        <item>
            I use git for my VCS and GitHub as my remote repository. I\'m capable of using git in both the command terminal
            and IDE. I have a GitHub account showcasing some of the work I\'ve done. If you\'re interested, check out

        By using an NFC (near-field communication) tag the restaurant name, table number
        and seat number can be immediately paired to a customer’s phone.
    </string>
    <string name="tastebudz_course">
        When a customer scans a tag with a phone running Tastebudz, the phone will immediately download the
        restaurant’s menu, if it isn’t stored already, and allow the customer to order whatever is available.
    </string>
    <string name="tastebudz_item">
        Besides being a vastly more cost efficient solution, Tastebudz allows restaurants to customize their menu with
        greater detail and can take into account user preferences such as food allergies.
    </string>
    <string name="tastebudz_order">
        The customer can view an image of the item, a description, a list of ingredients, a calorie amount and price.
        As you order, Tastebudz keeps track of the items as well as total price and calories.
