            I’ve been programming in Java and developing Android applications for over three
            years.

            \n\nI’ve developed android apps that use activities, fragments, layouts,
            adapters, classes, client libraries designed to communicate with backend APIs,
            LRUcache, SQLite and navigation drawers. These apps have used the camera and nfc
            adapter in smartphones. I\'ve also used Firebase services such as crashlytics,
            authentication and uploading images.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve designed backend APIs in Python that communicate with frontend client applications
            using JSON. I\'m familiar with OAuth2.0.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve designed cloud applications in Python supported by Google App Engine (GAE). These
            applications use the webapp2 framework and the Jinja template.

            \n\nI’ve also created NoSQL databases that supply data to the web application and the
            backend API. I’ve used cloud applications to transmit various data including text, image
            urls and prices.</item>

        <item>
            I’ve created web applications using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS and have had these
            applications interact with the cloud applications I’ve created.

            \n\nBy interacting, data could be submitted to the cloud database and retrieved as well.</item>

    <string name="background_information">
        \nI\'ve been developing mobile apps since 2015.
        I spent a year learning and programming in multiple programming languages such as Java and Python.
        Now I\'m able to utilize technology essential to many different applications. I have two applications found
        on the Google Play Store.

        Tastebudz is an app I developed that is intended for the restaurant industry. By using the nfc adapter on
        customer\'s phone, customers can quickly scan an nfc tag and be paired with the restaurant\'s menu. This allows
        for digital ordering and many more features.

        In 2006 I enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of
        Engineering and in 2010 I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering with a minor in
        mathematics. From my pursuit of a B.S., I\'ve learned to work effectively in a team setting.

        \n\nDuring my stay, I contributed to research studying Power Quality (PQ) events in power
        lines and power outlets.

        \n\nAfterwards, I worked for over 4 years at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
        My daily activities included reviewing and prosecuting applications and arguing against and
        negotiating with patent attorneys. I worked at the GS-11 level.
